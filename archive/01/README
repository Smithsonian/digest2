1.  Program Overview

Digest2 does statistical ranging for short arc moving object
astrometry.  It accepts astrometry in the MPC 80 character
observation format and rates objects on the likelyhood that they are
yet-unknown near Earth objects.

It was developed around 2002 according to a comment in the code, and
unfortunately hasn't been improved much since.  It's presented here in
a rough, but working, state.  It's a Fortran program, provided as
source under an MIT-style open source license, and available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/statrange/.

Say you have some unidentified observations.  For example, here are
the discovery observations of the NEO 2005 OJ3.  (See MPEC 2005-P07
at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mpec/K05/K05P07.html.)

     C5O0011  C2005 07 30.88575 20 11 19.47 -11 08 07.6          19.1 R      599
     C5O0011  C2005 07 30.89573 20 11 18.69 -11 08 08.1          19.2 R      599
     C5O0011  C2005 07 30.90566 20 11 17.91 -11 08 08.6          19.0 R      599

You put them in a file, say fmo.obs, then type "digest2 fmo.obs" and 
get the following output:

Unknown population.
     #      Design    Score   NEO?   Elong  Elat  ElongR   ElatR  TotalR  VMag
     1      C5O0011    39.4   NEO   -174.8   8.7  -0.315   0.056   0.320  19.4

It tells you that this object has some modest chance of being a NEO.  
While it's not certain to be a NEO (the score was only 37.6 out of 100
possible) it's probably still worthy of follow up or at least a closer
evaluation.

CAVEAT:  The NEO Score is effectively a guess and sometimes the guess
is just plain wrong.  Lots of real NEOs spend a good part of the time
displaying a motion easily consistent with the main belt.  During this
time, short arc astrometry will give very low NEO scores.  Also, there
is a range of non-NEO orbits that return very high NEO scores with
the current code.  Use the program as one more tool to help you make
decisions.  Don't rely on it completely or you'll get frustrated when
it guesses wrong.


2.  Downloading

The source and associated files are available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/statrange/.  Look for the "Latest File
Releases" section and download the package called Digest2.  It contains
all needed files.


3.  Unpacking, building, installing

The package is bzip2 tarball which you can unpack on most unix-like
systems with the command "bzip2 -cd digest2.tar.bz2  | tar xvf -"
The contents are:

README        this file
LICENSE       open source license
digest.f      source code
AST.BIAS.POP  complete population model
AST.UNKN.POP  unknown population model
obscode.dat   observatory parallax constants

The source is just a single source file, digest2.f, and "f77 digest2.f
-o digest2" works for me.  On my machine anyway, this produces a
working executable.  Installing consists of just making sure you have a
couple of other files present in the same directory:

* AST.BIAS.POP and AST.UNKN.POP are text files representing a model of
the asteroid population.  One or both of them must be present in the
directory with the executable, otherwise they are ready to use and
nothing needs to be done to them.

* obscode.dat is a text file containing parallax constants for MPC
assigned observatory codes.  It must also be present in the directory
with the executable.

* .digest2, a configuration file, can optionally be present.  This is
a file you can create.  The format is described below.

* You probably want the input file containing your observations to be 
present as well, although if you like, you can type a full path to 
specify an input file in any directory.


4.  Usage

digest2 [<input file>]

As in the example, you can type the input file on the command line.  
Otherwise the program prompts you for the file name with:

 INPUTFILE (J2000 OBSERVATIONS)

Type the file name just as you would have on the command line.  The
file must contain observations in the MPC 80 column observation
format, the observations should be sorted, and there should be at
least two observations of each object.

In the output, the program shows a line number for each object, the
NEO score, a NEO flag if the score is over 25, Ecliptic latitude and
longitude, ecliptic latitude and longitude rates of motion, a total
rate of motion, and the calculated V magnitude.  The program shows the
code "OSS" in the NEO flag column if the object might be an outer
solar system object.

The program can evaluate observations against one of two models of the
asteroid population.  One is a hypothetical model of the complete
population of the asteroid belt, represented in the file AST.BIAS.POP.  
The other is this same model, but reduced by the population of actual
discovered asteroids with well known orbits, and is represented in the
file AST.UNKN.POP.  Which model you use depends on whether you have
tried to identify your object.  If you have observations of a real
object, you have tried to identify it, for example with the
"MPChecker" at http://scully.harvard.edu/~cgi/CheckMP, and it seems
unknown, then this "unknown" population is most appropriate.  For 
other purposes, the "complete" population is likely more appropriate.

There is no user interface for selecting the population model.  The
program simply looks for AST.UNKN.POP first, then if that's not
present it looks for AST.BIAS.POP, and if that's not present, it
terminates with an error message.  If you have both files but want to
use the complete population model, rename or otherwise remove
AST.UNKN.POP from the program directory so that the program only finds
AST.BIAS.POP.

A configuration file allows for a few options useful in cases where 
you want to use the output as input to another program.  The 
configuration file name is .digest2 and is optional.  The recognized 
options are:

headings on/off
messages on/off
neoflag on/off

for example, if your configuration file contains

headings off
messages off
neoflag off

then you get a flat table of data with nothing else.

The file obscode.dat, included in the package, contains observatory
parallax constants.  In the case that you have data with a new MPC
assigned observatory code and the code is not not listed in this file,
you can update the file from the MPC website.  Visit
http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html with a browser, save
the page as text, then edit the saved file to remove the introductory
text and the column headings.


5.  Theory

The theory behind the program is explained in detail in a paper
currently in preparation.  Basically though:

1.  For each object, the program computes a motion vector from the
first and last observation, and computes a V magnitude from whatever
photometry is provided.

2.  It then generates a whole mess of orbits that are consistent with
the computed motion, complete with absolute magnitudes consistent with
the computed V magnitude.  It iterates over a parameter space with enough
resolution to hopefully generate orbits representative of anything
that might possibly have that motion.

3.  It looks up each generated orbit in the population model and gets
a "bin count" of the number of modeled asteroids that have similar
orbits and absolute magnitudes.  It accumulates two totals, the total
of all the bin counts and the total of just NEOs.

4.  It computes the NEO score as 100 times the NEO total divided by
the all-bin total.  It's a percentage then, although it can't reliably 
be interpreted as a probability (due to various reasons -- approximations,
simplications, shortcuts, and so on in the code.)

For any object -- whether NEO or ordinary main-belt -- the set of
generated orbits will include many wild NEO orbits.  The population
model identifies these orbits as highly improbable by returning very
low (often zero) bin counts, so the NEO total doesn't go up much for
these.  The NEO total will go up somewhat when orbits are found that
are believable as real NEOs.  Because non-NEOs -- main-belt asteroids
in particular -- vastly outnumber NEOs however, the all-bin total goes up
dramatically when believable non-NEO orbits are found.  This leads to
very low NEO scores when objects are likely main belt objects, but
higher scores otherwise.
